Clojure-Go
==========

Clojure on the Go runtime.

Development
-----------

I find Go's model of development environment configuration to be confusing. Since I find I have to re-learn it each time I come back to it, I might as well document the fact that the expectation is that this package sits in $GOPATH/src.

Hence, go/main.go would sit at $GOPATH/src/clojure-go/go/main.go.
